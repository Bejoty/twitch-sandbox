# Twitch Sandbox

A web application built to interface with the Twitch API and handle user interaction.

## Description

This project was built as part of an entrance exam for the Code Fellows 401-level course. As such, it is meant to represent knowledge in many areas and must:

- be served by an Express.js server
- use a SQL database to persist data
- perform multiple external API calls
- use a template engine library
- exhibit user interactivity
- be thoughtfully styled
- consider usability in its design
- be deployed on a live server

Due to time constraints for the project deadline, this application will inevitably lack the polish expected in production code. As such, it likely needs various architecture revisions, documentation, and test coverage.
